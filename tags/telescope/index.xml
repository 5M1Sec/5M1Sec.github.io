            </div>Recently, I purchased my first telescope. Soon I conducted my first observing session in my backyard. It was full moon, but the view condition isn&rsquo;t that perfect. The view though telescope is wonderful, but not as astonishing as I imagined. I took some pictures though telescope by my phone. It is not perfectly but I still love it.
Images I cropped the image for file sizing.
10x" 10x  30x" 30x  Overall, I was very exciting during the whole observation.]]></description>
