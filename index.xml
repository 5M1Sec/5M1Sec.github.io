    <description><![CDATA[Discourse is an open source forum framework. I found it is used in the forum I visited. I did an installation on the $5 Digital Ocean Droplet. Then I realize a lot of forums are using it by recognizing its optional styles.
The official website is here. At first glance, the website does not mention self-hosting options. But in the &ldquo;about&rdquo; page, you will find the Github repository.
Note on Digital Ocean Droplet The installation is extremely easy.]]></description>

            </div>Recently, I purchased my first telescope. Soon I conducted my first observing session in my backyard. It was full moon, but the view condition isn&rsquo;t that perfect. The view though telescope is wonderful, but not as astonishing as I imagined. I took some pictures though telescope by my phone. It is not perfectly but I still love it.
Images I cropped the image for file sizing.

    <description><![CDATA[Note  This is a cheatsheet that came along with the installation of Manjaro i3wm. I ported the PDF version to this Markdown format.
From the signature, the original author is oberon.
It is tedious for me to open helper PDF every time and resize it to my preference.
I hope this will help you navigating in the i3.
   Welcome to manjaro i3! The default mod-key is &lt;Super&gt; (Windows-key).]]></description>

    <title>Setting Up Wireguard VPN in Raspberry Pi</title>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This tutorial will help you setting up a Wireguard VPN on Raspberry Pi by using PiVPN installer. This article will use Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) for installation. The <a href="https://www.pivpn.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PiVPN</a> site claims the installer will also work on Debian and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I choose <strong>Wireguard</strong> over <strong>OpenVPN</strong> due to the convenience of connecting though QR code. In <strong>OpenVPN</strong>, you have to transfer security key via USB stick and some extra works to transfer it to a phone. However <strong>OpenVPN</strong> has the option with more encryption bits, but more encryption bits will cost more to compute and slow the transfer time. You can find out more in the <a href="https://www.pivpn.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PiVPN</a> website.</p>
<p>I assume my audience have little background knowledge, so hope you can follow this without any problem. <strong>But I do not assume that you know how to type in the terminal.</strong></p>]]></description>
