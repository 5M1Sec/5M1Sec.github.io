    <description><![CDATA[In this part, I will attempt to add a facial detection function in my security camera. Because I notice that there exist a real time facial detection library online. The end result for now is not satisfied by any means. I will try to improve this in the future.
Installing OpenCV Note  Install Python 3.5 for better compatibility.   Please be aware with the version of OpenCV. I installed the OpenCV 4 in Raspberry in July 2020.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This post will cover the basic function of the project, sending and receiving videos.
I choose the official API for camera sending usage. My site also have a copy with a table of content that helps you navigate the content. It is a higher level implementation of OpenMAX. There is also a Python library for Pi camera that you can use.
Save Video Locally Run raspivid --timeout 0 --bitrate 800000 --segment 10000 -v -a 4 -a %Y-%m-%d-%X --output video_%c.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I wanted a security camera for a while. There are many reasons that I am insist building it. Of course, the primary reason is for fun. If you are looking for a complete product, there are some open source pi security projects built already. For example, the MotionEyeOS. I personally have not installed it, but you can check out the YouTube for other people&rsquo;s review. I want my Pi run other tasks whiling serving as a security camera.]]></description>

    <title>Setting Up Wireguard VPN in Raspberry Pi</title>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This tutorial will help you setting up a Wireguard VPN on Raspberry Pi by using PiVPN installer. This article will use Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) for installation. The <a href="https://www.pivpn.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PiVPN</a> site claims the installer will also work on Debian and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I choose <strong>Wireguard</strong> over <strong>OpenVPN</strong> due to the convenience of connecting though QR code. In <strong>OpenVPN</strong>, you have to transfer security key via USB stick and some extra works to transfer it to a phone. However <strong>OpenVPN</strong> has the option with more encryption bits, but more encryption bits will cost more to compute and slow the transfer time. You can find out more in the <a href="https://www.pivpn.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PiVPN</a> website.</p>
<p>I assume my audience have little background knowledge, so hope you can follow this without any problem. <strong>But I do not assume that you know how to type in the terminal.</strong></p>]]></description>
